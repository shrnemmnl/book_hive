✅ Option 1: Dump & Restore (Simple, Manual, Reliable)
This is like “take a backup file from work → restore at home”.

✨ At Work (Export):
bash
Copy
Edit

pg_dump -U your_user -h localhost -d your_db_name > ecommerce_backup.sql


🔐 Use your actual DB user and DB name
📁 The output is a plain SQL file

📨 Transfer that ecommerce_backup.sql to your home system
You can use:

GitHub (private repo or a Gist — if small)

Google Drive / Dropbox

Pendrive if you like old school

Rsync / SCP (if you're a terminal warrior)

✨ At Home (Import):
bash
Copy
Edit

psql -U your_user -h localhost -d your_db_name < ecommerce_backup.sql
